### FAQ
#### Question: Can I import starlists?

Yes! Select the "EXPORT" button to begin the process. You can also export as JSON, or write to your Starlist Directory. 

#### Question: Can I send my target starlist to my starlist directory?
Yes!

#### What does that Green checkmark and Flame icon mean on some of my targets?
The front-end application has a validator that checks if there are any potential issues on how the target is formed. For example, A Target may have an invalid RA/Dec format, or it may be missing parameters needed. The validator acts as a warning that there may be issues with parsing the target. You are still able to create and save targets, even with flames. Clicking on a flame will bring up a dialog of what the reasons are.
